# Aubrey Anderson's Portfolio

The purpose of this repository is as a portfolio of my web development work done for COMP20.

My favorite assignment has been the group project. It's given me a chance to use
different tools and be creative. I've enjoyed working and coordinating with a
team of people so that we can each work on the pieces that we enjoy and learn
about the parts of web development that interest us.

I've think I've grown a fair amount over the course of this class. I've learned
how to take more responsibility for my own learning as well as how to manage my
time well to complete the assignments for this class and COMP40 in a timely
manner. I've also learned different programming paradigms, such as asynchronous
programming, which has helped me to examine web programming problems from a
different perspective.

I think that the most important thing that I learned in this course was how to
use asynchronous programming to program effective and clean websites. This has
been very useful in helping me understand how to properly program an
auto-complete dropdown for foods in our group project. Without asynchronous
programming, the user would not be able to continue typing until the database
query had returned a value. Asynchronous programming was also very useful in
assignment 2. This allowed the map to load even if the locations server wasn't 
working.

Now that I've finished with this course, I want to delve deeper into the
different types of programming languages and how different programming paradigms
can effectively solve different problems.
