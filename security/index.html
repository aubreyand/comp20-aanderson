                        <h4>Introduction</h4>
                        <p> This assessment elaborates the security flaws found in
                                Julia Cooper's Checkins client and server. The client
                                serves to display the locations on a map of
                                nearby landmarks and people provided by the
                                server. The server also provides an API for
                                viewing all checkins from a certain login.
