        <h2>Security Assessment of Landmarks Server and Client</h2>
        <hr />
        <div id=intro class=para>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                This assessment tests the security and privacy of the
                landmarks client and server developed by Julia Cooper.
                The landmarks client reports the user's current location
                to a server, displays the locations of other users and
                close landmarks, and marks the closest landmark. This
                functionality is according to the specification to which
                the landmarks client was built. 
            </p>
            <p>
                According to the landmarks server specification, the
                product provides a location API which allows a user to
                send their location and receive the checkins of other
                users and landmarks within 1 mile. It also provides a web
                interface to view the most recent checkins. Finally, it
                provides an API to request all the checkins of any given
                user.
            </p>
            <p>
                By using blackbox testing and source code analysis, the
                product was thoroughly assessed for security and privacy
                related concerns. There are some inherent privacy flaws in
                the specification of the product. This assessment focuses
                both on the security issues of the implementation and the
                privacy issues in the specification.

            <h3>Methodology</h3>
            <p> 
                In order to test the security of the server and the client
                I performed two types of testing. The first type was
                blackbox testing. During this phase, I found as many flaws
                as I could without looking at the source code. This is the
                same information that a potential attacker of this product
                would have. The second phase was to examine the source
                code of both the client and the server to find any other
                potential flaws that may have been missed during the
                blackbox phase.

            <h3>Abstract of Findings</h3>
            <p> 
                The security issues on the server arise from not checking
                data for the possibility of malicious input.
                Vulnerabilities on the server's index page allow an
                attacker to crash the user's browser or
                redirect them to a malicious website.  There is a security
                flaw that allows an attacker to search for all the
                checkins of all users. This is a major privacy issue as it
                allows an attacker to view the most recent location of any
                user. Additionally, the display of the most recent
                checkins on the server's  index is a potential
                privacy issue as it also allows even a naive attacker to
                view the location of any user.

            <h3>Issues Found</h3>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li> <h4>Cross-Site Scripting</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li> Affects sendLocation POST API, checkins.json GET API, and server's web interface (index page)</li>
                            <li> <p>High: This makes the landmarks server a security risk
                                both to visit and to use its API as malicious code can be
                                executed on a user's browser.
                            </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                The sendLocation POST API neglects to sanitize user input
                                for the login name. In this way, an attacker could submit
                                html or javascript instead of an actual login name. The
                                server's web interface displays the logins without
                                escaping html tags which allows malicious javascript code
                                to be executed.</p>
                            <p>
                                To test this vulnerability, the following request was sent
                                using curl:<br/>
                                <code>
                                    curl --data 'login=&lt;script&gt;alert("This could be
                                    malicious code");&lt;/script&gt;&lat=42.1&lng=-71.0'
                                </code><br/>
                                Which caused this javascript alert to appear when visiting
                                the web interface of the server.<br/>
                                <img src=xss.png alt="Proof of XSS"k>
                            </p>
                                <p>
                                    This vulnerability could also be an issue for
                                    external clients to the POST or GET APIs that receive
                                    javascript in the login field of the returned JSON
                                    from the APIs. If the client displays the JSON without
                                    sanitizing the login field, then the malicious
                                    javascript could be run. By not sanitizing user
                                    input from the APIs, the server opens up clients
                                    of the API to vulnerabilities as well.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    This flaw can be corrected rather easily by sanitizing
                                    the user input in the login field before inserting the
                                    entry into the database. This can be done with the
                                    following code.<br/>
                                    <code>
                                        login.replace(/&/g, '&amp;amp;').replace(/&lt;/g,
                                        '&amp;lt;').replace(/"/g, '&amp;quot;');
                                    </code> <br/>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Checkins already stored in the database could be
                                    sanitized using: <br/>
                                    <code>
                                        db.people.update();
                                    </code>

                                </p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li> <h4>Mongo Injection</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Affects checkins.json GET API</li>
                            <li> <p>Medium: The severity of this security flaw depends on
                                    the intended purpose of the API. If the purpose is to
                                    provide a general way to query the checkins, then it
                                    is a non-issue. However, if the intended purpose is
                                    only to provide a way for a user to examine the
                                    checkins of a user for which they know the login then
                                    this is a major issue.
                            </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    The checkins.json API does not properly sanitize the
                                    login query parameter. This allows an attacker to
                                    embed special MongoDB operators in the query. Thus an
                                    attacker could perform arbitrary queries on the login
                                    field of the database.
                                </p>

                                To test this vulnerability, the following request was sent

                                </code><br/>
                                Which caused all entries for all users to be displayed as
                                a JSON object.<br/>

                                    This flaw can be corrected by sanitizing
                                    the user input in the login query parameter before
                                    performing the query. This can be done with the
                                    following code.<br/>
                                    <code>
                                        <pre>
                                        for (var key in query.body.login) {
                                            query_login = query.body.login[key];
                                        }
                                        db.people.find({login: query_login});
                                    </pre>

                                    This code ensures that the query parameter is
                                    preserved while protecting against embedded Mongo
                                    query operators in the query parameter.
                                </p>

                            <li> <p>High: The locations of any user who uses the landmarks
                                    client is available for anyone to view both on the
                                    POST API and the web interface. This is a major
                                    privacy concern because the locations are linked to a
                                    login name which would allow an attacker to know the
                                    location of any user.

                                    Any valid request to the sendLocation API returns all
                                    checkins for all users. A request to the server's
                                    index page returns a sorted list of the most recent
                                    checkins including timestamps. This would allow a
                                    stalker to know the recency with which a user was at
                                    the stored location. Finally, the checkins.json API
                                    would allow an attacker to view the checkins for any
                                    user if they knew the users login name.

                                    This privacy flaw can be corrected by allowing users
                                    to not associate their name with the checkin in order
                                    to receive landmark data. In the meantime users should
                                    be urged to use logins that cannot be associated with
                                    them for the sake of their privacy. Alternatively, A
                                    user could be assigned an API key and be given the
                                    option to determine whether they want their checkin to
                                    be publicized.

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                The landmarks server has multiple security flaws that make it a large risk
                for a client to any of the APIs or web interfaces. These problems can be
                fixed by sanitizing all existing user input in the database and continuing
                to sanitize user input before it is inserted into the database.
                This product reveals the location of any user publicly which
                is a major privacy concern. This could be improved by adding an API key so
                that only authorized users are allowed to view the locations of other
                users. Additionally, an optional field could be added to the POST API
                which allows a user to set the desired visibility of their CHECKIN.
                A combination of these improvements would greatly increase the security
                and privacy afforded by this product.
