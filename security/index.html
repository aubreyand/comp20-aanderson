                                THIS SHOULD BE LONGER
                                This assessment elaborates the security flaws found in
                                Julia Cooper's Checkins client and server. The client
                                serves to display the locations on a map of nearby
                                landmarks and people provided by the server. The server
                                also provides an API for viewing all checkins from a
                                certain login.

                        <h4>Methodology</h4>
                        <p> 
                                In order to test the security of the server and the client
                                I performed two types of testing.  The first type was
                                blackbox testing. During this phase, I found as many flaws
                                as I could without looking at the source code. This is the
                                same information that a potential attacker of this product
                                would have. The second phase was to examine the source
                                code of both the client and the server to find any other
                                potential flaws that may have been missed during the
                                blackbox phase.

                        <h4>Abstract of Findings</h4>
                        <p> 
                                The security issues on the server arise from not checking
                                data for the possiblity of malicious input.
                                Vulnerabilities on the server's index page and in the
                                client allow an attacker to crash the user's browser or
                                redirect them to a malicious website.  There is a security
                                flaw that allows an attacker to search for all the
                                checkins of all users. This is a major privacy issue as it
                                allows an attacker to view the most recent location of an
                                user. Additionally, the display of the most recent
                                checkins on the server's index index is a potential
                                privacy issue as it also allows even a naive attacker to
                                view the location of any user.
